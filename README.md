For Clear and clean code, we use [EsLint](/project-template/.eslintrc) and Vscode configaration [Editor Configaration](/project-template/.editorconfig)

## The API & testing out authentication
We've created a quick little "API server" on [Google's Firebase Platform](https://firebase.google.com/). You can get your own API up and running within minutes too:

1. Signup for a [Crowderia account](https://auth.crowderia.com/)
1. Create a new project - eg. "React Native Starter App"
